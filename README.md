# NixOS & home-manager configuration for a Chromebook 11 3180

This repository contains the necessary configuration files of a NixOS
installation along with Home Manager for a Chromebook 11 3180. This can be used
to create a development environment on these particular laptops.

## Status

While this configuration is usable, it's currently only tailored for me and
does not contain everything that is needed. It's also not optimized at all.
Eventually, this Nix code will be usable and extendable by anyone who would
like to use NixOS with Home Manager on a Chromebook 11 3180.
